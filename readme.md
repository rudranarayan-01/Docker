# Docker
- Docker is a open source platform
- Using for building, running, managing applications by packing them into a standardize unit called container. 
- Docker has two components docker container and docker images 

## Docker Container 
- A standardized, executable unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Docker Images 
- A read-only template that contains the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and dependencies needed to run an application. 
- It's a blueprint for creating Docker containers, which are isolated instances of an application and its environment.
